Task 1 - Create an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item.
The navigation menu should have a fixed position and be visible on all pages. 
Use HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity, such as changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over.

What the website does - 

HTML:
Defines the structure with a sticky nav bar (site logo and menu links) and sections (Home, About, Services, Portfolio, Team, Blog, Contact) with scroll-to links.
Includes a hamburger icon for toggling the nav links on smaller screens.
CSS:
Styles the page with a fixed nav bar that changes color on scroll (default blue, opaque on scroll).
Menu links are white by default and yellow on hover.
Sections have distinct background colors (e.g., blue for Home, green for About).
Responsive design stacks grid layouts vertically on smaller screens.
JavaScript​:
Implements smooth scrolling for navigation links.
Toggles visibility of nav links on mobile via the hamburger icon.
Changes link color to yellow on hover, reverting to default on mouse out.
